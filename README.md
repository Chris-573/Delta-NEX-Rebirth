# Pump It Up Delta NEX Rebirth

### DO NOT USE THIS IN ARCADES. DO NOT ENABLE PAY MODE. DO NOT SELL IT. DO NOT REMOVE THE CREDITS. NO NO NO. 

An old StepMania theme, modded and fixed to support StepMania 5.0.12 along with other stuff.

Rebirth mod written by Rhythm Lunatic with new graphics created by Joao Almeida.

This theme is 100% free and open source. Don't abuse it and shove it on your bootlegged PIU machine, go buy the game if you want to run a business.

Q: Why do my StepF2 files look weird / not work at all?

A: Because supporting closed source software with zero documentation is a pain in the neck.

Q: Why is the difficulty select broken when I put in a file made in StepF2?

A: Because StepF2 ignores difficulties and only uses meters, normal StepMania doesn't. Either make all your difficulties "Edit" or pray for a fix.

Q: Why are DP charts only playable in single player, and Co-op charts only playable in multiplayer?

A: StepF2, being the paragon of good standards, uses Double charts for Double Performance instead of Routine. Sometimes StepF2 uses Routine for Co-op even though it makes no distinction between DP and co-op (and by extension, Double Performance and Routine). However, Routine is meant for two players. Personally I think Co-op charts should be playable in both single and two player mode on PIU, but that's Andamiro's fault.

Q: I get an error when I press UpLeft or UpRight on the song select screen.

A: Your StepMania is out of date. Use my branch or grab a nightly from the main branch.
