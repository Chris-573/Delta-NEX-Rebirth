# Pump It Up Delta NEX Rebirth

### DO NOT USE THIS IN ARCADES. DO NOT ENABLE PAY MODE. DO NOT SELL IT. DO NOT REMOVE THE CREDITS. NO NO NO. 

An old StepMania theme, modded and fixed to support StepMania 5.0.12 along with other stuff.

Rebirth mod written by Rhythm Lunatic with new graphics created by Joao Almeida.

This theme is 100% free and open source. Don't abuse it and shove it on your bootlegged PIU machine, go buy the game if you want to run a business.

Q: Why do my StepF2 files look weird / not work at all?

A: Because supporting closed source software with zero documentation is a pain in the neck.

Q: Why is the difficulty select broken when I put in a file made in StepF2?

A: Because StepF2 ignores difficulties and only uses meters, normal StepMania doesn't. Either make all your difficulties "Edit" or pray for a fix.

Q: I get an error when I press UpLeft or UpRight on the song select screen.

A: Your StepMania is out of date. Use my branch or grab a nightly from the main branch.
