# Pump It Up Delta NEX Rebirth

### DO NOT ENABLE PAY MODE. DO NOT SELL THIS THEME. DO NOT REMOVE THE CREDITS. NO NO NO. 

An old StepMania theme, modded and fixed to support StepMania 5.0.12 along with other stuff.

Rebirth mod written by Rhythm Lunatic with new graphics created by Joao Almeida. Rest of the credits are in credits.txt

This theme is 100% free and open source. Don't abuse it and shove it on your bootlegged PIU machine, go buy the game if you want to run a business.

## Song Group Configuration

To add descriptions to your song groups, add a folder named info inside your song group and then add a file named text.ini with the song group description inside it.

The theme will automatically hide group numbers if you have them (Such as 15-PRIME -> PRIME, 05-SKILLUP ZONE -> SKILLUP ZONE)

## Announcers

To add announcers, make an announcer with a folder named Song Category Names and then put in the sound that matches your groups.

Alternatively, you can just put the sound in the "info" folder in your group, as long as it's named sound.ogg/wav/mp3.

## Basic Mode

Basic Mode must be enabled in the settings to use this feature.

The Basic Mode screen consists of songs that meet the requirements of having three single difficulties less than lv7 and one doubles difficulty less than lv7.

Just like real PIU you can enter the full mode code to go into full mode.

## Free Play

When using Free Play, you will be able to play three stages. This theme does not use PIU's heart system.

Extra Stage and OMES is currently unimplemented.

When not in game the theme will cycle through the Attract, logo, and title screen.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why is the difficulty select broken when I put in a file made in StepF2?

A: Because StepF2 ignores difficulties and only uses meters, normal StepMania doesn't. Either make all your difficulties "Edit" or pray for a fix.

Q: Why do some StepF2 created songs end instantly?

A: The song file only has EDIT difficulties, give it at least one real difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, Challenge).

Q: Why are DP charts only playable in single player, and Co-op charts only playable in multiplayer?

A: StepF2, being the paragon of good standards, uses Double charts for Double Performance instead of Routine. Sometimes StepF2 uses Routine for Co-op even though it makes no distinction between DP and co-op (and by extension, Double Performance and Routine). However, Routine is meant for two players. Personally I think Co-op charts should be playable in both single and two player mode on PIU, but that's Andamiro's fault.

Q: Nothing happens when I press UpLeft or UpRight on the song select screen.

A: Your StepMania is out of date. Update to 5.0.12 or higher.

Q: Your theme lags when I scroll through songs.

A: Can't be fixed without editing the StepMania source. It runs at full speed on Linux, though. (ProTip: Use a lowlatency kernel if you're putting this on your arcade cabinet!)
